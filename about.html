          <h3>Kung Fu Panda 3</h3>
         
          <p>
            Continuing his journey to become a perfect Kung-fu master, Po begins teaching after his master Shifu retires, but this is much more difficult than he thought. Meanwhile, he meets his real father, Li. While he is having a pleasant time with Li, the evil Kai starts defeating all the kung-fu masters and stealing their powers. Po's only solution is to go to a mountain village where only pandas live and teach kung-fu to the fun-loving and clumsy pandas there.
